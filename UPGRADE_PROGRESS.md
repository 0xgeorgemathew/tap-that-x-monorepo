## Phase 1: Core UX Foundations (High Impact)

### 1.1 Navigation Overhaul ✅ Completed
**Goal:** Replace pagination dots with bottom tab navigation matching navbar glass design

**Tasks:**
- [x] Analyze current `UnifiedNavigation` component
- [x] Design bottom tab layout (Home, Register, Approve, Payment)
- [x] Implement glass aesthetic matching top navbar
- [x] Add icons (24x24dp) and labels
- [x] Ensure 56dp height, 44-48px touch targets (72px height, 64x56px min touch targets)
- [x] Position within thumb zone (fixed bottom positioning)
- [x] Add bottom padding to all pages (pb-24 / 96px)

**Research Justification:**
- 80% of payment apps use bottom navigation (thumb-zone optimization)
- 75% of mobile interactions are thumb-driven
- Bottom third = "natural zone" for one-handed use (49% of users)

**Implementation Details:**
- Icons: Home, Nfc, Shield, CreditCard (lucide-react)
- Glass effect: backdrop-filter blur(20px), rgba backgrounds matching navbar
- Active state: Enhanced opacity, border, box-shadow with theme support
- Accessibility: aria-labels, role="navigation", aria-current for active page
- Touch targets: 64px min-width, 56px min-height (exceeds 44-48px requirement)

**Files Modified:**
- [x] `components/UnifiedNavigation.tsx` - Refactored from pagination to bottom tabs
- [x] `styles/globals.css` - Added `.bottom-tab-nav`, `.bottom-tab`, `.bottom-tab-active` classes
- [x] `app/page.tsx` - Added pb-24 for bottom nav clearance
- [x] `app/register/page.tsx` - Added pb-24
- [x] `app/approve/page.tsx` - Added pb-24
- [x] `app/payment/page.tsx` - Added pb-24

**Status:** ✅ Completed (2025-10-20)

**Research Justification:**
- 3-step processes achieve 72% completion vs 42% (2-step) or 45% (4-step)
- 5+ steps see 80% skip rate
- Numbered steps > abstract dots for completion rates

**Implementation Details:**
- Register Steps: "Detect Chip" → "Sign Authorization" → "Confirm Transaction"
- Payment Steps: "Detect & Verify" → "Authorize Payment" → "Process Transaction"
- Visual design: Numbered circles for upcoming/current, checkmarks for completed
- Connecting lines between steps with gradient effects
