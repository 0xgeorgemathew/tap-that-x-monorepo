# Tap That X - Migration Complete ‚úÖ

## Summary of Changes

Successfully refactored from USDC-specific payment contracts to a generalized Tap That X protocol while maintaining the same user flow: **Register ‚Üí Approve ‚Üí Tap to Pay**.

All permit functionality removed - pure pre-approval tap-to-pay with NO MetaMask popups during payment.

## Contract Changes

### Old Structure
```
contracts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChipRegistry.sol
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChipAuthVerifier.sol
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ USDCPaymentProcessor.sol (with permit)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MockUSDC.sol
```

### New Structure
```
contracts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TapThatXRegistry.sol       (was ChipRegistry)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TapThatXAuth.sol           (was ChipAuthVerifier - enhanced)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TapThatXProtocol.sol       (NEW - generic executor)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ USDCTapPayment.sol         (NEW - demo, no permit)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MockUSDC.sol
```

## Key Contract Renamings

| Old Name | New Name | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `ChipRegistry` | `TapThatXRegistry` | Chip registration |
| `ChipAuthVerifier` | `TapThatXAuth` | Signature verification library |
| `USDCPaymentProcessor` | `USDCTapPayment` | USDC payment example |
| N/A | `TapThatXProtocol` | Generic execution engine (NEW) |

## Architecture Overview

```
User approves USDC to TapThatXProtocol
        ‚Üì
User taps chip (signs CallAuthorization)
        ‚Üì
Relayer calls USDCTapPayment.tapToPay()
        ‚Üì
USDCTapPayment calls TapThatXProtocol.executeAuthorizedCall()
        ‚Üì
Protocol verifies chip & executes USDC transfer
```

## Frontend Changes

### Contract References Updated

**Register Page (`/register`):**
- `ChipRegistry` ‚Üí `TapThatXRegistry`
- Domain name: `TapThatXRegistry`

**Approve Page (`/approve`):**
- Approves `TapThatXProtocol` (not USDCPaymentProcessor)
- User grants unlimited USDC allowance

**Payment Page (`/payment`):**
- Uses `CallAuthorization` EIP-712 type (not PaymentAuth)
- Domain name: `TapThatXProtocol`
- Relays to `USDCTapPayment.tapToPay()` (not executePayment)

**API Route (`/api/relay-payment`):**
- Calls `USDCTapPayment.tapToPay()`
- Uses new contract addresses

## Deployment

### Deploy All Contracts

```bash
# From project root
yarn deploy --network baseSepolia
```

This deploys (in order):
1. `TapThatXRegistry` - Chip ownership registry
2. `TapThatXProtocol` - Generic execution engine
3. `MockUSDC` - Test USDC token
4. `USDCTapPayment` - Example USDC payment implementation

### Deployed Contract Names

The deployment script (`Deploy.s.sol`) will export ABIs with these names:
- `TapThatXRegistry`
- `TapThatXProtocol`
- `MockUSDC`
- `USDCTapPayment`

These names will auto-populate in `packages/nextjs/contracts/deployedContracts.ts`.

## User Flow (Unchanged)

1. **Register Chip** (`/register`)
   - User connects wallet
   - Taps chip to get chip address
   - Chip signs EIP-712 registration message
   - User confirms transaction to register chip on-chain

2. **Approve USDC** (`/approve`)
   - User approves unlimited USDC to `TapThatXProtocol`
   - One-time transaction, no MetaMask popups after

3. **Tap to Pay** (`/payment`)
   - User taps chip at merchant
   - Chip signs `CallAuthorization` for USDC transfer
   - Relayer submits transaction (gasless for user)
   - Payment completes - no MetaMask popup!

## EIP-712 Signature Changes

### Old (PaymentAuth)
```javascript
{
  name: "USDCPaymentProcessor",
  types: {
    PaymentAuth: [
      { name: "from", type: "address" },
      { name: "to", type: "address" },
      { name: "amount", type: "uint256" },
      { name: "timestamp", type: "uint256" },
      { name: "nonce", type: "bytes32" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### New (CallAuthorization)
```javascript
{
  name: "TapThatXProtocol",
  types: {
    CallAuthorization: [
      { name: "owner", type: "address" },
      { name: "target", type: "address" },
      { name: "callData", type: "bytes" },
      { name: "value", type: "uint256" },
      { name: "timestamp", type: "uint256" },
      { name: "nonce", type: "bytes32" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Testing

All tests pass:
```bash
forge test --match-path "test/TapThatX.t.sol"
```

Test coverage:
- ‚úÖ Chip registration
- ‚úÖ Chip re-registration (hackathon flexibility)
- ‚úÖ Generic call execution
- ‚úÖ USDC tap payment
- ‚úÖ Replay protection
- ‚úÖ Timestamp expiry
- ‚úÖ Unregistered chip rejection

## What Was Removed

‚ùå **EIP-2612 Permit Functionality**
- No more `permit()` calls
- No permit signatures
- Pure pre-approval model

‚ùå **USDCPaymentProcessor Contract**
- Replaced with `USDCTapPayment` example
- Uses protocol for execution

‚ùå **PaymentAuth Struct**
- Replaced with generic `CallAuthorization`
- Works for any contract call, not just payments

## Environment Variables

Make sure `.env` has:
```bash
RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...              # Relayer wallet (funded with gas)
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=...                    # For Base Sepolia RPC
```

## Production Notes

For production deployment:
1. Use real USDC address (not MockUSDC)
2. Fund relayer wallet with more gas
3. Consider rate limiting on relay API
4. Add emergency pause mechanism
5. Multi-sig governance for protocol

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Deploy to Base Sepolia
2. ‚úÖ Test full flow (register ‚Üí approve ‚Üí pay)
3. ‚úÖ Update frontend with deployed addresses
4. üöÄ Demo tap-to-pay at hackathon!

## Rollback (If Needed)

Original contracts still exist in git history. To rollback:
```bash
git revert HEAD  # Or specific commit
```

But you won't need to - everything works! üéâ
