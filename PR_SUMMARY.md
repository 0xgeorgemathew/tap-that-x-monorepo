- [TapThatXAavePositionCloser.sol](packages/foundry/contracts/extensions/TapThatXAavePositionCloser.sol) (322 lines)
  - Tap-to-close entire Aave position
  - Flash loan pays off all debt → withdraws all collateral → swaps to cover loan
  - Returns remaining assets to user
  - Access control: only authorized relayers can execute

**Test Coverage:**
- [TapThatXAaveRebalancer.t.sol](packages/foundry/test/TapThatXAaveRebalancer.t.sol) (287 lines)
- [TapThatXAavePositionCloser.t.sol](packages/foundry/test/TapThatXAavePositionCloser.t.sol) (286 lines)

### 2. Uniswap V2 Integration
**New Files:**
- [IUniswapV2.sol](packages/foundry/contracts/interfaces/IUniswapV2.sol) - Interface for Uniswap V2 Router
- [manage-uniswap-liquidity.ts](packages/nextjs/scripts/manage-uniswap-liquidity.ts) (390 lines) - Script for pool management

### 3. Documentation
**New Documentation:**
- [AAVE_REBALANCER_IMPLEMENTATION.md](AAVE_REBALANCER_IMPLEMENTATION.md) (1,095 lines)
  - Comprehensive implementation guide

  - Testing procedures

## Core Contract Updates

### Simplified & Cleaned
The core TapThat X contracts were refactored for clarity:

**[TapThatXAuth.sol](packages/foundry/contracts/core/TapThatXAuth.sol):**
- Reduced from verbose to streamlined signature validation
- Removed 43 lines of unnecessary code

**[TapThatXConfiguration.sol](packages/foundry/contracts/core/TapThatXConfiguration.sol):**
- Minor cleanup (9 line reduction)

**[TapThatXExecutor.sol](packages/foundry/contracts/core/TapThatXExecutor.sol):**
- Code cleanup (4 line reduction)

**[TapThatXProtocol.sol](packages/foundry/contracts/core/TapThatXProtocol.sol):**
- Streamlined execution logic (12 line reduction)

**[TapThatXRegistry.sol](packages/foundry/contracts/core/TapThatXRegistry.sol):**
- Removed 6 lines of dead code

**Total Core Reduction:** -62 lines (more efficient, cleaner code)

## Frontend Updates

### Enhanced Configuration UI
**[configure/page.tsx](packages/nextjs/app/configure/page.tsx):**
- Added support for Aave rebalancing actions
- Better action template system
- Improved form validation

### Improved Approval Flow
**[approve/page.tsx](packages/nextjs/app/approve/page.tsx):**
- Better approval status display
- Support for multiple token approvals
- Enhanced UX with clearer messaging

### Action Templates Expansion
**[actionTemplates.ts](packages/nextjs/utils/actionTemplates.ts):**
- New template structure for Aave operations
- Better modularity for adding future DeFi integrations

### Gasless Relay Enhancement
**[relay-execute-tap/route.ts](packages/nextjs/app/api/relay-execute-tap/route.ts):**
- Support for extension contract execution
- Better error handling
- Improved logging

## Infrastructure Updates

### Deployment Configuration
**[Deploy.s.sol](packages/foundry/script/Deploy.s.sol):**
- Updated deployment script for Aave extensions
- Added deployment tracking for new contracts
- Fixed trailing whitespace

**[deployedContracts.ts](packages/nextjs/contracts/deployedContracts.ts):**
- Massive cleanup: -3,667 lines removed, +3,057 added
- Regenerated with new contract ABIs
- Includes TapThatXAaveRebalancer and TapThatXAavePositionCloser

### Dependencies
**[.gitmodules](.gitmodules) & [remappings.txt](packages/foundry/remappings.txt):**
- Added `aave-v3-core` as git submodule
- Updated import remappings for Aave contracts

**[84532.json](packages/foundry/deployments/84532.json):**
- Updated deployment addresses for Base Sepolia
- Includes new Aave extension contracts

## Key Technical Highlights

### Flash Loan Integration
```solidity
// Example: Rebalance with 10 USDT flash loan
1. Borrow 10 USDT from Aave pool (0.05% fee)
2. Repay 10 USDT of user's debt
3. Withdraw freed collateral (0.00256 WETH)
4. Swap WETH → USDT on Uniswap
5. Repay flash loan + fee
6. Return remaining tokens to user
```

### Access Control
Both extension contracts use `onlyAuthorizedRelayer` modifier to prevent unauthorized execution:
```solidity
modifier onlyAuthorizedRelayer() {
    require(authorizedRelayers[msg.sender], "Not authorized relayer");
    _;
}
```

### Chain Agnostic Design
- Domain separators exclude chainId
- Same chip can be used across multiple chains
- Cross-chain position management ready

## Testing

All tests pass (as confirmed by user):
- ✅ TapThatXAaveRebalancer.t.sol
- ✅ TapThatXAavePositionCloser.t.sol
- ✅ TapThatX.t.sol (existing tests)

## Breaking Changes
**None.** This is a pure addition - all existing functionality preserved.

## Migration Notes
No migration required. New features are opt-in extensions.

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control:** Relayer-only execution prevents unauthorized flash loan operations
2. **Signature Validation:** Chip signatures required for all operations
3. **Slippage Protection:** Minimum output amounts enforced on swaps
4. **Reentrancy Guards:** All state-changing functions protected
5. **Flash Loan Safety:** Aave's flash loan callback validates repayment

## Deployment Checklist
- [x] Contracts deployed to Base Sepolia
- [x] Tests passing
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Frontend integrated
- [x] Relay API updated
